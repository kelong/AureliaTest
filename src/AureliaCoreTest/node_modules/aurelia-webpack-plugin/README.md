This library is part of the [Aurelia](http://www.aurelia.io/) platform and contains a Webpack plugin designed to enable proper Webpack bundling.

## Installation

Install with npm

```
npm install aurelia-webpack-plugin
```

## Usage

Add the plugin to the webpack config file:

```javascript
var AureliaWebpackPlugin = require('aurelia-webpack-plugin');
var webpackConfig = {
  entry: 'index.js',
  output: {
    path: 'dist',
    filename: 'index_bundle.js'
  },
  plugins: [new AureliaWebpackPlugin()]
}
```

## Configuration options

The plugin accepts an options object with the following properties:

*src*

The directory where the app source files are located. Defaults to './src'.

*root*

The root project directory. Defaults to the directory from where webpack is called.

## Module resource resolution

Module resource resolution is what makes Aurelia's Loader and Dependency Injection work. It's what translates require paths to places in the bundle or external files that are loaded asynchronously.

Some Aurelia modules or plugins have more than 1 file that need to be resolved (for example, when a plugin also contains an html template).
By default, the whole `src` folder and their static dependencies (by default, but see [includeDependencies](#includeDependencies)) are loaded into the loader's context.
If you wish to make resources available for dynamic use, you need to explicitly `<require>` them either in your `.html` resources or from the `package.json` file.

Since there are cases that cannot be supported by statically analyzing files (e.g. it is possible to generate require paths dynamically), there's an additional way to declare external dependencies, or in case of Aurelia plugins, to declare internal dependencies by listing those additional resources in the `package.json` file. Listing these dependencies in your package.json allows you include extra files in the bundles.

To see the ways resources can be declared inside `package.json` see the following example:

```js
{
  ...
  "aurelia": {
    "build": {
      "resources": [
        // relative to your /src:
        "some-resource.js",
        "another.html",
        "items/another-without-extension",

        // make the file and its dependencies lazy-load from a separate bundle:
        { "path": "external-module/file.html", lazy: true, bundle: "some-bundle" },
        { "path": [], lazy: true, bundle: "some-bundle" },

        // include external resource (and its module's dependencies)
        "aurelia-templating-resources/compose"

        // include package (and its module's dependencies):
        "bootstrap"
      ],

      // you may also override package's root directory in case the file is located at a different place from either the child of main or module's root directory
      "moduleRootOverride": {
        "aurelia-templating-resources": "dist/es2015"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The Webpack plugin will read that and know to include those files in the bundle.

It'll be intelligent enough to resolve any further dependencies that those files and modules then required statically (regardless if they are JavaScript files, modules with their own `package.json` declarations or additional HTML resources).
As you can see in the example above, it is also possible to specify that certain files should be lazy-loaded or bundled separately (if the bundle is specified in the configuration file). To achieve the same directly from templates, add the parameters `bundle="bundle-name"` and/or `lazy` (for lazy-loading) to either the `<require>` tag or to `<compose>` tag, when composing with static names. E.g.:

```html
<require from="./some-file.html" lazy bundle="other-bundle">
```

<a name="includeDependencies"></a>
### includeDependencies

By default, all static dependencies (as listed in `package.json` under `dependencies`) are pulled into context recursively. This works fine for simple setups, but if your project also contains some node.js code (e.g. server stuff), there may be dependencies on packages which should not go into the client-bundle, because not
only they are superfluous, but even may break bundling, if they in turn depend on node-only modules (e.g. `'fs'`).

So you can narrow down these included packages by specifying `includeDependencies` in your `package.json` file. That value can contain a single glob-pattern (possibly negated by a preceding `!`) or an array of such patterns (see [matcher](https://www.npmjs.com/package/matcher) for details).

Example:
```json
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "aurelia-templating-router": "^1.0.0",
    "yargs": "^6.0.0"
  },
  "aurelia": {
    "build": {
      "resources": [
        ...
      ],
      "includeDependencies": "aurelia-*"
    }
  }
}
```

Now only packages starting with `"aurelia-"` are pulled into the bundle, preventing `'yargs'` from slipping in.
In this example the same result could be achieved by specifying `"includeDependencies": "!yargs"`.

## Example configuration: custom app directory (other than './src')

```javascript
var path = require('path');
var AureliaWebpackPlugin = require('aurelia-webpack-plugin');
var webpackConfig = {
  entry: 'index.js',
  output: {
    path: 'dist',
    filename: 'index_bundle.js'
  },
  plugins: [
    new AureliaWebpackPlugin({
      src: path.resolve('./app')
    })
  ]
}
```

## Declaring build resources in plugins

Plugins also can define build resources that are always loaded with your plugin. For those resources that are optional, it's recommended to instruct your users to declare those in the `package.json` of their app, so they don't unnecessairly bundle files they don't use.

In a plugin, the paths specified as build resources can be resolved as one of the following:
- relative to the root directory of the module
- relative to the parent directory of `main` (so that if your `main` is set to `dist/index.js` then you can specify relative to `dist`)
- let the user decide by overriding the root directory of your package, by adding a key-value pair alias as a key of `aurelia.build.moduleRootOverride` in their `package.json`, where the `key`is the module/plugin name and value is the path, relative to root of the plugin
- **SUBJECT TO CHANGE**: specify a custom `main` which contains your code with JS modules (with `import` and `export`s) by additionally declaring an `aurelia.main.native-modules` entry in your plugin's `package.json`, and write resources relative to the parent directory of the file specified. We'll eventually want to standardize, when an official method of using modules in Node is decided upon. To support a similar `main` field for `modules`, support [this proposal](https://github.com/dherman/defense-of-dot-js/blob/master/proposal.md).
